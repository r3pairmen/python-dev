Using the Dashboard
The dashboard will display a bar chart showing the intensity, relevance, and likelihood of data entries by year.
You can use the filters provided on the dashboard to filter the data by year, country, topics, region, PESTLE, and source.
The chart will update dynamically based on the selected filters.
API Endpoint
The backend API provides the data for the dashboard. The data can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/api/data/. You can use this endpoint to fetch data for your own frontend applications if needed.
